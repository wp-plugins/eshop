== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work with Wordpress MU =

When WordpressMU utilises WP2.5, then hopefully yes.

= I'm upgrading from an earlier version of eShop =

For versions prior to eShop 2.5 follow these steps:

Disable old version, and delete. If you have amended any css, or email templates or you use the downloads - you might want to keep a copy first. Upload the new plugin, and re-upload the downloads, css and email templates as required.

Go to *settings - eshop base* and **reset** eshop base. This is required to reset the data due to wordpress 2.5 utilising a new image uploader.

Go to the following pages and amend:

* Shopping Cart: remove `<!--eshop_show_cart-->` replace with `[eshop_show_cart]`
* Checkout: remove `<!--eshop_show_checkout-->` replace with `[eshop_show_checkout]`
* Thank you for your order:remove `<!--eshop_show_success-->` replace with `[eshop_show_success]`
* Cancelled Order: remove `<!--eshop_show_cancel-->` replace with `[eshop_show_cancel]`
* Downloads: remove `<!--eshop_show_downloads-->` replace with `[eshop_show_downloads]`
* Shipping rates: remove `<!--eshop_show_shipping-->` replace with `[eshop_show_shipping]`

adjust other pages that use the code: 

* `<!--eshop_list_random-->` becomes `[eshop_random_products]`
* `<!--eshop_random_product-->` becomes `[eshop_random_products list='no']`
* `<!--eshop_list_featured-->` becomes `[eshop_list_featured]`
* `<!--eshop_list_subpages-->` becomes `[eshop_list_subpages]`
